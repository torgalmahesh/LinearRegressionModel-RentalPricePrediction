## Company Introduction

Client for this project is an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities.
- Home Sweet Home (HSH) allows hosts to rent their homestays to other people as guests.
- The company acts as a mediatory service for the same and has more than 80,000 hosts across 19 cities.
- Their goal is to provide the best hospitality service to their customers in a more unique and personalized manner.

## Current Scenario
- The company is planning to introduce a new system that will help to easily monitor and predict the rental prices of homes across various cities.
---

## Problem Statement

The current process suffers from the following problems:

- The company monitors and validates the prices set by the hosts.
- The process of validation is based on various factors such as <b>city, neighborhood, neighborhood group, location on map, availability, and reviews</b>.
- It is <b>time-consuming, resource-consuming,</b> and sometimes <b>inaccurate</b> to estimate the proper price based on so many factors.

They have hired you as a data science consultant. They want to supplement their analysis and prediction with a more feasible and accurate approach.

<b>Your Role</b>
-  are given a historical dataset that contains the price of rental homes and many factors that determine that price.
- Your task is to build a regression model using the dataset.
- Because there was no machine learning model for this problem in the company, you donâ€™t have a quantifiable win condition. You need to build the best possible model.

<b>Project Deliverables</b>
- Deliverable: <b>Predicts the rental price of accommodation.</b>
- Machine Learning Task: <b>Regression</b>
- Target Variable: <b>price</b>
- Win Condition: <b>N/A (best possible model)</b>

<b>Evaluation Metric</b>
- The model evaluation will be based on the <b>RMSE</b> score.
